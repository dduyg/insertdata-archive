While both internet connections and devices are getting faster every year, websites are getting larger, counteracting performance.

The weight of a website (also called page weight or page size) refers to how much data needs to be transferred from the website to the device in order to display content. This amount has been steadily increasing compared to just ten years ago. Devices and data connections are used more heavily when surfing the web.
