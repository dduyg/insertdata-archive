Since humans began to explore the world beyond the earth, the fear of the unknown universe has never stopped. From Armageddon to Don’t look up, this kind of fear is continuously visualized in films, and it feels like one day there must be an asteroid flying directly towards our planet and ruining everything.

Before we start worrying, we should get to know about these “NEOs”, whose full spelling is near-earth-object. A near-earth-object is any small Solar System body whose orbit brings it into proximity with Earth. Most known NEOs are asteroids, but a small fraction are comets. Near-Earth asteroids are those whose closest approach to the Sun is less than 1.3 astronomical unit (AU). 1 AU is equal to the distance from Earth to the Sun.
