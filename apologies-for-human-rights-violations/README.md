While apologies between individuals are quite complex, political apologies are even more difficult. Many countries struggle with how to deal with past wrong doings. 

The Political Apologies across Cultures research project funded by the European Research Council put together a database of the 366 apologies that do exist from states or state representatives around the world. Each apology included arrived there through some recognition for human rights violations that happened in the recent or distant past. 

Apologies have increased over the years, peaking in 2018 among political figures. To date, six countries stand above the rest with more recognitions of human rights violations than any others: Japan, Germany, the U.K., the U.S., Canada and the Netherlands.
